Absolutely! As a DevOps engineer, understanding how to **search for artifacts** in **Nexus Repository** using the REST API is essential for automating CI/CD pipelines, verifying deployments, or writing scripts to fetch or validate builds.

Let’s break everything down clearly and then look at practical examples.

---

## 🔍 What is the Search API?

The Nexus Search API lets you **find artifacts** stored in your Nexus repositories — things like:

- Maven `.jar` or `.pom` files
    
- Docker images
    
- NuGet packages
    
- etc.
    

---

## ✅ Basic Syntax:

```bash
curl -u <username>:<password> \
"http://<nexus-host>:8081/service/rest/v1/search?<query-params>"
```

---

## 🧠 What Does Each Part Mean?

|Part|Description|
|---|---|
|`curl`|Command-line tool to make HTTP requests|
|`-u admin:admin123`|Basic auth (username and password)|
|`http://localhost:8081`|Base URL of your Nexus server|
|`/service/rest/v1/search`|Search endpoint|
|`?name=my-app`|Query parameter (filter by name of the artifact)|

---

## 🔎 Useful Query Parameters (you can combine them)

|Param|What it does|
|---|---|
|`name`|Filter by artifact name (e.g., `my-app`)|
|`group`|Maven group ID (e.g., `com.example`)|
|`version`|Exact version of the artifact|
|`repository`|Search in a specific repo (e.g., `maven-releases`)|
|`format`|Artifact format (e.g., `maven2`, `docker`)|

---

## 🔧 Examples

---

### 1. 🔍 Find artifacts named "my-app"

```bash
curl -u admin:admin123 \
"http://localhost:8081/service/rest/v1/search?name=my-app"
```

---

### 2. 🔍 Find "string-utils" in `maven-releases` repository

```bash
curl -u admin:admin123 \
"http://localhost:8081/service/rest/v1/search?name=string-utils&repository=maven-releases"
```

---

### 3. 🔍 Find all Maven artifacts from group `com.example`

```bash
curl -u admin:admin123 \
"http://localhost:8081/service/rest/v1/search?group=com.example"
```

---

### 4. 🔍 Find specific version of an artifact

```bash
curl -u admin:admin123 \
"http://localhost:8081/service/rest/v1/search?name=my-app&version=1.0.0"
```

---

### 5. 🔍 Combine everything: group + name + version + repo

```bash
curl -u admin:admin123 \
"http://localhost:8081/service/rest/v1/search?group=com.example&name=my-app&version=1.0.0&repository=maven-releases"
```

---

## 📄 Sample Response

When the API finds something, it returns a JSON like:

```json
{
  "items": [
    {
      "downloadUrl": "http://localhost:8081/repository/maven-releases/com/example/my-app/1.0.0/my-app-1.0.0.jar",
      "path": "com/example/my-app/1.0.0/my-app-1.0.0.jar",
      "name": "my-app",
      "version": "1.0.0",
      "repository": "maven-releases"
    }
  ]
}
```

You can use the `downloadUrl` in your scripts to fetch the artifact.

---

## 🚀 Real DevOps Use Cases

|Use Case|Example|
|---|---|
|**CI/CD pipeline**|Verify artifact exists before deploying|
|**Backup/Restore**|Download specific version of an artifact|
|**Audit**|Search what artifacts were published|
|**Automation**|Write shell scripts that use Nexus API for version checks|

---

## 📌 Pro Tip

If you're writing scripts and want to extract just the download URL:

```bash
curl -s -u admin:admin123 "http://localhost:8081/.../search?..." | jq -r '.items[].downloadUrl'
```

(_Requires `jq` for JSON parsing_)
