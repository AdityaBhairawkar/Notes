Great! As a DevOps engineer, understanding how to **upload files (artifacts)** to a **Nexus Repository** using `curl` is very important — especially when you're automating builds and deployments with tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI, or GitHub Actions.

Let's break it all down **step-by-step** and include real-world examples so you can confidently use and modify this command.

---

## ✅ 1. What is this command doing?

```bash
curl -u admin:admin123 \
  --upload-file my-app-1.0.jar \
  http://localhost:8081/repository/my-maven-repo/my-app/1.0/my-app-1.0.jar
```

It uploads a file (`my-app-1.0.jar`) to a **Maven-style hosted repository** on your Nexus server.

## 📦 Structure of the Command

|Part|Meaning|
|---|---|
|`curl`|A command-line tool to transfer data (like uploading/downloading)|
|`-u admin:admin123`|Username and password for Nexus authentication|
|`--upload-file my-app-1.0.jar`|The file you want to upload|
|`http://localhost:8081/...`|Target URL where the file will be uploaded (repository + path)|

---

## 🧱 URL Structure (Maven Style)

```
/repository/<repository-name>/<group>/<artifact>/<version>/<filename>
```

Let’s break it down:

- **repository-name**: The name of the Nexus repository (e.g. `my-maven-repo`)
    
- **group**: Your package namespace (e.g. `com/example`)
    
- **artifact**: Project/module name (e.g. `my-app`)
    
- **version**: Version of the artifact (e.g. `1.0.0`)
    
- **filename**: Actual file name (e.g. `my-app-1.0.0.jar`)

## 🔁 Real Examples

### 🔹 Example 1: Upload a JAR to a Maven repo

```bash
curl -u admin:admin123 \
  --upload-file target/my-app-1.0.0.jar \
  http://localhost:8081/repository/maven-releases/com/example/my-app/1.0.0/my-app-1.0.0.jar
```

### 🔹 Example 2: Upload a ZIP file to a raw repository

```bash
curl -u admin:admin123 \
  --upload-file app-config.zip \
  http://localhost:8081/repository/raw-configs/env/dev/app-config.zip
```

> 🧠 In a `raw` repo, you can define any folder structure. It’s not bound to Maven conventions.

## 🔒 Tips on Credentials

- Never hard-code passwords in scripts. Use:
    
    - Environment variables
        
    - `.netrc` files
        
    - Secret managers

## 🧠 Maven vs Raw vs Docker (Quick Comparison)

|Repository Type|Use Case|Upload Style|
|---|---|---|
|`maven2 (hosted)`|Java `.jar`, `.pom`|Structured, Maven-style path|
|`raw`|Any file (e.g., `.zip`, `.tar.gz`)|Freestyle path|
|`docker`|Docker images|Use Docker CLI, not curl|

---

## 🚨 Common Mistakes

|Mistake|Fix|
|---|---|
|Wrong repo name|Make sure the repo exists in Nexus|
|Wrong path|Follow the Maven convention if it's a Maven repo|
|401 Unauthorized|Wrong username/password or missing permission|
|404 Not Found|The repo URL is wrong (check the path)|

---

## ✅ Final Tips for DevOps

- Use Nexus REST API for automation.
    
- Assign appropriate **roles/privileges** to Jenkins/GitLab users.
    
- Monitor your blob store usage.
    
- Use **cleanup policies** to automatically delete old artifacts.
