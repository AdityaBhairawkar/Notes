Absolutely! Let’s break down **everything you need to know** about downloading artifacts from **Sonatype Nexus** using `curl` as a **DevOps engineer**, with **clear explanation** and **multiple examples**.

---

## 🧱 The Basic Command

```bash
curl -u username:password -O URL_TO_ARTIFACT
```

### 🔍 What each part means:

|Part|Meaning|
|---|---|
|`curl`|A tool to send HTTP requests from the command line.|
|`-u admin:admin123`|Logs in using username and password.|
|`-O`|Saves the file with its original name (from the server).|
|`http://...`|The full URL of the file you want to download from Nexus.|

---

## ✅ Real Example:

```bash
curl -u admin:admin123 -O http://localhost:8081/repository/my-maven-repo/com/example/string-utils/1.0.0/string-utils-1.0.0.jar
```

This command:

- Logs into Nexus as `admin`
    
- Downloads a `.jar` file from the `my-maven-repo` repository
    
- Saves it as `string-utils-1.0.0.jar` in your current directory

## 🧠 How Do I Know the Right URL?

The URL structure usually follows Maven’s layout:

```
http://<host>:<port>/repository/<repo-name>/<group-id-path>/<artifact-id>/<version>/<artifact>.jar
```

For example:

```
http://localhost:8081/repository/my-maven-repo/com/example/utils/1.0/utils-1.0.jar
```

---

## 🔐 Example with Different Users

```bash
curl -u devuser:devpass -O http://192.168.1.38:8081/repository/maven-releases/com/example/app/2.1.0/app-2.1.0.jar
```

This logs in as `devuser` and downloads a `.jar` file from the `maven-releases` repo.

## 🛠️ Optional `curl` Flags You Might Use

|Flag|Description|Example|
|---|---|---|
|`-u`|Basic auth|`-u aditya:654321`|
|`-O`|Save with original name|`-O http://.../file.jar`|
|`-o file.jar`|Save with custom name|`-o custom-name.jar http://...`|
|`-L`|Follow redirects (often needed for proxy repos)|`-L http://...`|
|`-I`|Just fetch headers (check if file exists)|`-I http://...`|

---

## 🔁 Download Multiple Files (Example: All versions)

You can use a shell loop:

```bash
for version in 1.0.0 2.0.0; do
  curl -u admin:admin123 -O http://localhost:8081/repository/my-repo/com/example/utils/$version/utils-$version.jar
done
```

## 💡 Pro Tips as a DevOps Engineer

- 🔐 **Never hard-code passwords** in scripts; use environment variables or secret managers.
    
- 📦 **Use `-I` first** to verify the artifact exists before downloading:
    
    ```bash
    curl -I -u admin:admin123 http://localhost:8081/repository/...
    ```
    
- 📁 Know that artifacts follow Maven-style folder structure.
    
- 🔄 Automate artifact fetch in CI/CD using tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI, or Ansible.
    
- 🔍 Use Nexus REST APIs to list versions or components (useful for dynamic downloads).

## ✅ Summary

As a DevOps engineer, here's what matters:

|Task|What to Do|
|---|---|
|Download artifact|Use `curl -u user:pass -O URL`|
|Know the URL|Follow Maven folder pattern|
|Secure credentials|Use environment variables or token auth|
|Handle multiple files|Use a loop or script|
|Automate|Include in CI/CD pipeline|
