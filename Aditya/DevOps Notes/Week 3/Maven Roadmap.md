Here’s a **simple, practical Maven roadmap** tailored _specifically_ for a **DevOps engineer** — not too deep, just what you need for build automation and CI/CD.

# ✅ Maven Roadmap for DevOps Engineers

### 📅 Week 1: Basics & Setup

**Goal:** Understand what Maven is, how it works, and set it up.

-  ✅ What is Maven? (Purpose, role in build process)
    
-  ✅ Install Maven on your machine
    
-  ✅ Understand Maven lifecycle (validate → compile → test → package → install → deploy)
    
-  ✅ Learn the structure of a Maven project (`src/main/java`, `pom.xml`, `target/`)
    
-  ✅ Run basic Maven commands:
    
    - `mvn clean`
        
    - `mvn compile`
        
    - `mvn package`
        
    - `mvn install`
        
    - `mvn test`
        

---

### 📅 Week 2: `pom.xml` & Dependencies

**Goal:** Understand and modify the `pom.xml`.

-  ✅ Learn what `pom.xml` is (Project Object Model)
    
-  ✅ Understand key elements:
    
    - `<groupId>`, `<artifactId>`, `<version>`
        
    - `<dependencies>`
        
    - `<build>` (basic use, e.g., plugins like compiler or surefire)
        
-  ✅ Add a dependency (e.g., Gson or JUnit)
    
-  ✅ Learn how Maven downloads dependencies to `~/.m2/repository/`
    

---

### 📅 Week 3: Practical Maven Usage in CI/CD

**Goal:** Learn how Maven fits into automation pipelines.

-  ✅ Use `mvn clean install` in:
    
    - GitHub Actions
        
    - GitLab CI
        
    - Jenkins pipeline (scripted or declarative)
        
-  ✅ Skip tests during build:
    
    - `mvn install -DskipTests`
        
-  ✅ Cache `.m2` folder in pipelines to speed up builds
    
-  ✅ Handle common issues (e.g., dependency not found, build failure, test failure)
    

---

### 📅 Week 4: Artifact Management & Repos (Basic)

**Goal:** Learn how Maven artifacts are managed in DevOps.

-  ✅ Understand what `.jar` and `.war` files are
    
-  ✅ Understand local vs remote repositories:
    
    - Local: `~/.m2/`
        
    - Remote: Maven Central or Nexus/Artifactory
        
-  ✅ Upload/host artifacts using a tool like **JFrog Artifactory** or **Nexus**
    
-  ✅ Integrate Maven build output into a Docker container (optional, good practice)
