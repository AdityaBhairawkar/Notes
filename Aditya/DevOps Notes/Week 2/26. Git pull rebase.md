Sure! Let's break down **deleting `git pull --rebase`** and everything around it that you need to understand as a **DevOps engineer**, using **simple language** and **multiple examples**.

---

### 🔹 What is `git pull --rebase`?

When you run:

```bash
git pull --rebase
```

You're telling Git:

> "Get the latest changes from the remote (like `origin/main`) and reapply _my local commits_ on top of them."

This avoids **merge commits**, keeping the history **clean and linear**.

---

### 🔹 What happens under the hood?

1. **Fetches remote changes**.
    
2. **Temporarily removes your local commits**.
    
3. **Applies remote commits first**.
    
4. **Reapplies your local commits on top**.
    

So if you had:

```
Remote: A---B
Local:  A---B---C---D
```

After `git pull --rebase`, your history becomes:

```
Remote: A---B---E---F (new from remote)
Local:  A---B---E---F---C'---D' (your commits replayed on top)
```

C and D are replayed as **new commits** (`C'` and `D'`).

---

### 🔹 Why DevOps Engineers Use It

- Keeps commit history **linear and clean** (great for CI/CD pipelines).
    
- Avoids confusing **merge conflicts** from merge commits.
    
- Makes it easier to **track down issues** via `git bisect` or logs.

### 🔹 How to Delete / Undo `git pull --rebase`?

If something goes wrong (like conflicts, wrong changes, etc.), you can undo it.

#### ✅ 1. Use `git reflog` (Best way)

Git records every action in `reflog`. You can go back in time.

```bash
git reflog
```

You'll see something like:

```
abc1234 HEAD@{0}: rebase finished: returning to refs/heads/main
def5678 HEAD@{1}: pull --rebase: checkout main
```

To undo:

```bash
git reset --hard HEAD@{1}
```

This will **undo the rebase**, bringing you back to before `git pull --rebase`.

---

#### ✅ 2. If rebase is in progress and you're stuck

You can **abort** the rebase:

```bash
git rebase --abort
```

This will cancel the operation and take you back to your original state before rebase started.

---

#### ✅ 3. If rebase completed but you want to delete your local commits

You may want to get rid of the local changes after rebase:

```bash
git reset --hard origin/main
```

⚠️ This will delete all your local commits and make your branch exactly like `origin/main`.

---

### 🔹 Example Scenarios

---

#### 🔸 Example 1: You made local changes and forgot to pull

```bash
# local commits: A---B
# remote: A---C---D
git pull --rebase
```

Git now rebases like this:

```
A---C---D---B'
```

If you want to undo:

```bash
git reflog
git reset --hard HEAD@{1}
```

---

#### 🔸 Example 2: You get conflicts during rebase

```bash
git pull --rebase
```

Git says:

```
Conflict in app.py
Resolve conflicts and run 'git rebase --continue' or 'git rebase --abort'
```

If you're unsure, just run:

```bash
git rebase --abort
```

---

#### 🔸 Example 3: Accidentally deleted important local work

You can recover it using:

```bash
git reflog
# find the commit where your changes existed
git checkout <commit_hash>
```

You can also create a branch there:

```bash
git checkout -b recovery-branch <commit_hash>
```

### 🔹 Best Practices for DevOps

|Tip|Reason|
|---|---|
|Always check `git status` before and after pulling|Avoid confusion|
|Commit or stash before `git pull --rebase`|Prevent loss of work|
|Use `git rebase --abort` quickly if conflicts are scary|Save yourself|
|Use `reflog` often when in trouble|Git has your back|
|Avoid `--rebase` on shared branches unless you're confident|Can cause conflicts with teammates|

---

### 🔹 Summary

|Command|Use|
|---|---|
|`git pull --rebase`|Reapplies your local commits on top of updated remote|
|`git rebase --abort`|Cancel ongoing rebase|
|`git reset --hard HEAD@{1}`|Undo last rebase|
|`git reflog`|View Git history of all HEAD changes|
|`git reset --hard origin/main`|Delete local changes and match remote exactly|
