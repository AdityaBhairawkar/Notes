Sure! Let's break down each Docker command in **simple words** with **easy examples** so you can understand what they do and when to use them.

---

### 1. **Check Docker version**

**Command:**

```bash
docker --version
```

**What it does:**  
This command tells you **which version of Docker** is installed on your system.

**Why use it:**  
To check if Docker is installed, and to confirm the version before installing or updating.

**Example Output:**

```
Docker version 24.0.5, build abc123
```

**Real-life Example:**  
Imagine you’re baking a cake using a specific recipe. Before you start, you want to make sure you have the **correct oven version**. Similarly, this command checks if Docker is ready to use and what version you have.

---

### 2. **Start Docker service**

**Command:**

```bash
sudo systemctl start docker
```

**What it does:**  
It starts the **Docker engine** (also called the Docker daemon), which is the background service that allows Docker to run containers.

**Why use it:**  
If Docker isn't running, containers won’t work. You need to start the Docker service before using Docker.

**Note:**

- This command is used on **Linux** systems (like Ubuntu).
    
- You need to use `sudo` because starting a service requires **admin/root permission**.
    

**Example:**  
You're trying to run a container, but it doesn't work. You use this command to **start Docker** and fix the problem.

**Real-life Example:**  
It's like starting your **car engine** before you can drive. No engine = no driving. No Docker daemon = no containers.

---

### 3. **Check if Docker is running**

**Command:**

```bash
docker info
```

_or_

```bash
systemctl status docker
```

**What it does:**

- `docker info`: Shows detailed info about Docker's current status (like how many containers, images, etc.).
    
- `systemctl status docker`: Shows whether the Docker service is **active (running)** or **inactive (stopped)**.
    

**Why use it:**  
To check if Docker is running correctly or troubleshoot any issues.

---

#### **Example 1 – Using `docker info`:**

```bash
docker info
```

**Sample Output (shortened):**

```
Server Version: 24.0.5
Containers: 2
 Running: 1
 Stopped: 1
Images: 5
```

This tells you:

- Docker is running
    
- How many containers and images are present
    

---

#### **Example 2 – Using `systemctl status docker`:**

```bash
systemctl status docker
```

**Sample Output:**

```
● docker.service - Docker Application Container Engine
   Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/docker.service; enabled)
   Active: active (running)
```

If it says `active (running)`, Docker is working.  
If it says `inactive (dead)` or `failed`, Docker is not running.

---

**Real-life Example:**  
Think of `docker info` as checking your **car dashboard** for engine, fuel, battery, etc.  
Think of `systemctl status docker` as asking the **mechanic**: “Is the engine running?”

---

### Summary Table (Simplified):

|Action|Command|What it Means (in simple words)|
|---|---|---|
|Check Docker version|`docker --version`|Check if Docker is installed and what version it is|
|Start Docker service|`sudo systemctl start docker`|Turn on Docker engine so you can use it|
|Check if Docker is running|`docker info` or `systemctl status docker`|See if Docker is running and working fine|
