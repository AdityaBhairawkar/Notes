Here’s a **simple and clear explanation** for each Docker command in your table, with **easy-to-understand examples**.

---

### 🔍 1. `docker logs <container_id>` — View container logs

#### ✅ What it does:

This command shows the output (logs) from a container — like error messages or print statements from the app running inside it.

#### 🧠 Think of it like:

Looking at a journal or notebook where the container writes down everything it does or says.

#### 📦 Example:

```bash
docker logs 23acbd3e5f12
```

This shows the logs of the container with ID `23acbd3e5f12`.

#### 📝 Use case:

If your app inside the container is crashing or not working properly, you can check the logs to see what went wrong.

---

### 📊 2. `docker stats` — Show real-time usage metrics

#### ✅ What it does:

Shows live data (like CPU, memory, network, disk usage) for each running container.

#### 🧠 Think of it like:

Task Manager or Activity Monitor for your Docker containers.

#### 📦 Example:

```bash
docker stats
```

This will display something like:

```
CONTAINER ID   NAME         CPU %     MEM USAGE / LIMIT    NET I/O
23acbd3e5f12   my_web_app   2.54%     120MiB / 1GiB         5MB / 3MB
```

#### 📝 Use case:

You want to see which container is using too much memory or CPU.

---

### 🖥️ 3. `docker exec -it <container> bash` — Access shell of a running container

#### ✅ What it does:

Lets you go **inside** a running container and use the shell (like a terminal) to explore or run commands.

#### 🧠 Think of it like:

Opening the door and walking into the running container so you can work directly inside.

#### 📦 Example:

```bash
docker exec -it 23acbd3e5f12 bash
```

Now you’re inside the container. You can run Linux commands like:

```bash
ls
cd /app
```

#### 📝 Use case:

You want to debug or inspect files or configurations inside a running container.

---

### 🧾 4. `docker inspect <container>` — Get detailed configuration info

#### ✅ What it does:

Gives a **very detailed JSON output** about the container, including its settings, network, volume mounts, and more.

#### 🧠 Think of it like:

Looking at a **report card or blueprint** of the container’s entire setup.

#### 📦 Example:

```bash
docker inspect 23acbd3e5f12
```

You’ll see something like this (shortened for clarity):

```json
[
  {
    "Id": "23acbd3e5f12",
    "Path": "nginx",
    "State": {
      "Status": "running"
    },
    "NetworkSettings": {
      "IPAddress": "172.17.0.2"
    }
  }
]
```

#### 📝 Use case:

You want to know a container’s IP address, volume paths, or other settings.
