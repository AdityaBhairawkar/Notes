### 🔹 1. **List Docker Networks**

| **Command**: `docker network ls`  
| **Description**: Shows all the Docker networks on your system.

#### 🧠 What it means:

Docker uses **networks** to allow containers to talk to each other or to the outside world. You can create your own networks or use the default ones.

#### 🧪 Example:

```bash
docker network ls
```

#### ✅ Output Example:

```
NETWORK ID     NAME      DRIVER    SCOPE
f234f8f1a9c7   bridge    bridge    local
3dc9e30e3c08   host      host      local
a42b1e93db52   none      null      local
```

- `bridge`, `host`, and `none` are default Docker networks.
    
- You can also see custom networks you’ve created.

### 🔹 2. **Create a Docker Network**

| **Command**: `docker network create <net_name>`  
| **Description**: Creates a custom Docker network.

#### 🧠 What it means:

You can create your **own named network**. Useful when you want containers to talk to each other privately without using the default network.

#### 🧪 Example:

```bash
docker network create my_custom_net
```

#### ✅ Output:

```
9b8b08dc6e44adf79c33b5249f3b6c5eb8ec7fbd7ddf021ab7a1d6743aa7cd2f
```

- Now you have a network named `my_custom_net`.

### 🔹 3. **Connect a Container to a Network**

| **Command**: `docker network connect <network> <container>`  
| **Description**: Adds a running container to a specific network.

#### 🧠 What it means:

Sometimes, a container is started without being connected to a custom network. You can manually connect it to one.

#### 🧪 Example:

Step 1: Run a container

```bash
docker run -dit --name my_container alpine
```

Step 2: Create a network

```bash
docker network create my_custom_net
```

Step 3: Connect the container to the new network

```bash
docker network connect my_custom_net my_container
```

- Now `my_container` is connected to both the **default bridge** and **my_custom_net**.
    

---

### 🔹 4. **Disconnect a Container from a Network**

| **Command**: `docker network disconnect <network> <container>`  
| **Description**: Removes a container from a network.

#### 🧠 What it means:

You can remove a container from a network if it no longer needs to communicate through it.

#### 🧪 Example:

```bash
docker network disconnect my_custom_net my_container
```

- Now `my_container` is no longer connected to `my_custom_net`.
    

> ⚠️ Note: You **cannot disconnect** a container from its **only** network (like `bridge`) while it's running. You'll need to stop the container or make sure it has another network attached.
