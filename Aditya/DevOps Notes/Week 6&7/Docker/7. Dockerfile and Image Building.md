Sure! Here's a **detailed and simple explanation** of each Docker command in that table, with **easy-to-understand examples**:

---

### âœ… **1. Build Image**

**Command:**

```bash
docker build -t <name>:<tag> .
```

#### ðŸ’¡ What it does:

This command creates (builds) a Docker image from a **Dockerfile** that is in the current directory (`.`).

- `-t` stands for **tag**, which lets you give your image a **name** and an optional **version** (tag).
    
- `.` tells Docker to look for the Dockerfile in the **current folder**.
    

#### ðŸ§  Simple Example:

Imagine you have a Dockerfile in your folder, and you want to build an image called `myapp` with version `v1`.

```bash
docker build -t myapp:v1 .
```

This will build a Docker image and name it `myapp` with a version tag of `v1`.

---

### âœ… **2. Tag Image**

**Command:**

```bash
docker tag <source_image> <new_name>:<tag>
```

#### ðŸ’¡ What it does:

This command creates a new "label" (tag) for an existing image. Itâ€™s like **renaming** or preparing an image to be pushed to a Docker registry (like DockerHub).

- `<source_image>` is the image you already have.
    
- `<new_name>:<tag>` is the new name or version you want to give it.
    

#### ðŸ§  Simple Example:

Letâ€™s say you built an image named `myapp:v1`. Before uploading it to DockerHub, you want to tag it with your DockerHub username:

```bash
docker tag myapp:v1 yourusername/myapp:v1
```

Now, Docker knows this image belongs to your DockerHub account and is ready to push.

---

### âœ… **3. Push to DockerHub**

**Command:**

```bash
docker push <repo>:<tag>
```

#### ðŸ’¡ What it does:

This command uploads your image to DockerHub (an online storage for Docker images), so you or others can download and use it later.

- `<repo>` is your DockerHub repository (usually in the format `username/repo_name`)
    
- `<tag>` is the version (like `v1`, `latest`, etc.)
    

#### ðŸ§  Simple Example:

Using the previous step's tag (`yourusername/myapp:v1`), you can now upload it to DockerHub:

```bash
docker push yourusername/myapp:v1
```

This will push (upload) your image to your DockerHub account under the `myapp` repo with version `v1`.

### ðŸ§© Recap with Real-Life Analogy

Letâ€™s say you're a chef:

1. **Build (`docker build`)** = You create a dish from a recipe (Dockerfile).
    
2. **Tag (`docker tag`)** = You label the dish with a name and version before selling it.
    
3. **Push (`docker push`)** = You send the dish to an online food store (DockerHub) so others can order it.
