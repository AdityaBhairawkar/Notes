## 🛠️ Command to Build a Docker Image

```bash
docker build -t <name>:<tag> <path-to-dockerfile>
```

### 🧾 Explanation:

- `docker build` → Tells Docker to build an image.
    
- `-t` → Tags the image with a name and optional version.
    
- `<name>:<tag>` → Name your image and give it a version tag (like `v1`, `latest`, etc.).
    
- `<path>` → Directory where the `Dockerfile` is located (usually `.` for current folder).

## ✅ Example

```bash
docker build -t myapp:latest .
```

This:

- Builds the image in the current folder (where your `Dockerfile` is).
    
- Names the image `myapp`.
    
- Tags it as `latest`.
    

You can verify the image was created using:

```bash
docker images
```

## 🔖 More Tagging Examples

```bash
docker build -t mycompany/myapp:v1.0.0 .
```

- Good practice for versioning and organizing images (especially for pushing to Docker Hub or a registry).
    
- `mycompany` is optional — it's a namespace (useful for teams).

## 🗂️ Multiple Tags (Optional but Useful)

You can tag an image **after** building it too:

```bash
docker tag myapp:latest myapp:v1
```

This creates another tag (`v1`) for the same image.

## 🧹 Clean Up (Optional but Handy)

To delete an image:

```bash
docker rmi myapp:latest
```

## ✅ Full Workflow Example

```bash
# 1. Create Dockerfile
# (assume it’s ready in current directory)

# 2. Build image
docker build -t myapp:1.0 .

# 3. Run image
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 --name my-running-app myapp:1.0

# 4. See running containers
docker ps

# 5. See all images
docker images
```
