## 🔹 1. What is a Docker Volume?

A **Docker volume** is a **way to store data** used by containers, **outside** the container’s filesystem.

Think of it as:

> 💾 “A shared folder that exists on your machine (host), but is managed by Docker, and containers can read/write from it.”

This helps:

- Save data even if the container is deleted
    
- Share data between multiple containers
    
- Separate app code and app data

## 🔹 2. Why Use Volumes?

|Use Case|Why It's Useful|
|---|---|
|Container deletes shouldn't lose data|Volumes store data **persistently**|
|Share logs/config between containers|Volumes can be **shared**|
|Avoid rebuilding containers just for data changes|Volumes can be **mounted** from host or Docker volume|
|Backup / migration|Volumes can be **easily copied or backed up**|

---

## 🔹 3. Types of Storage in Docker

|Type|Where Stored|Use Case|
|---|---|---|
|**Volume**|Managed by Docker|Persistent, flexible|
|**Bind Mount**|Specific host path|Manual path mount, more control|
|**tmpfs Mount**|In memory|Temporary data, disappears on restart|

> ✅ For **most use cases**, **volumes** are preferred because they’re easy and safe.

## 🔹 4. Volume Commands (with Examples)

### 📦 Create a Volume

```bash
docker volume create myvolume
```

👉 Creates a volume named `myvolume`.

---

### 🔍 List All Volumes

```bash
docker volume ls
```

👉 Shows all Docker volumes on your system.

---

### 📂 Inspect a Volume

```bash
docker volume inspect myvolume
```

👉 Shows where it is stored on your host and other metadata.

---

### ❌ Remove a Volume

```bash
docker volume rm myvolume
```

👉 Deletes the volume. **Only works if no container is using it**.

---

### 🚮 Remove Unused Volumes

```bash
docker volume prune
```

👉 Deletes **all volumes not used by any container**.

---

## 🔹 5. Mounting Volumes into Containers

### ✅ Syntax (in `docker run`)

```bash
docker run -v volume_name:/container/path image_name
```

Example:

```bash
docker run -d -v myvolume:/app/data nginx
```

👉 The Nginx container can now read/write files in `/app/data`, which are stored in the volume `myvolume`.

---

### 📁 Mount Volume at a Different Path

```bash
docker run -v myvolume:/usr/share/nginx/html nginx
```

👉 Nginx serves static files from the volume.

---

### 📤 Share Volume Between Containers

```bash
# First container writes to volume
docker run -d --name writer -v sharedvol:/data busybox sh -c "echo Hello > /data/hello.txt"

# Second container reads from the same volume
docker run --rm --name reader -v sharedvol:/data busybox cat /data/hello.txt
```

✅ Output: `Hello`

👉 Perfect for shared logs, data exchange, etc.

---

## 🔹 6. Bind Mount (Alternative)

Instead of using named volume, you can use a **host folder path**:

```bash
docker run -v /home/aditya/logs:/app/logs nginx
```

✅ `nginx` container sees the folder `/app/logs` which maps directly to `/home/aditya/logs` on your computer.

### When to use:

- You want full control of the files
    
- You're working in dev environment
    
- You want to edit files from outside the container
    

---

## 🔹 7. Volume in Docker Compose

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  app:
    image: nginx
    volumes:
      - myvolume:/usr/share/nginx/html

volumes:
  myvolume:
```

👉 This will:

- Create a volume named `myvolume`
    
- Mount it to the container’s `/usr/share/nginx/html`
    

---

## 🔹 8. Useful Flags with Volumes

|Flag|Usage|Example|Description|
|---|---|---|---|
|`-v`|`volume_name:/path/in/container`|`-v myvol:/data`|Basic volume mounting|
|`--mount`|More readable, structured|`--mount type=volume,source=myvol,target=/data`|Better syntax for complex mounts|
|`--tmpfs`|Mount in-memory fs|`--tmpfs /app/cache`|Temporary data, auto-cleared|
|`-v $(pwd):/data`|Bind mount current folder|`-v $(pwd):/data`|Great for local dev/testing|

---

## 🔹 9. Volume Examples for Real Life

### 📝 Example: Store logs outside container

```bash
docker run -d -v logs:/var/log/myapp myapp
```

### 🧪 Example: Share database data

```bash
docker run -d -v dbdata:/var/lib/mysql mysql
```

Now MySQL data is stored in `dbdata` volume and survives restarts.

### 📚 Example: Develop code using local files

```bash
docker run -v $(pwd):/app node npm start
```

👉 You can edit files in VS Code and see live changes in the container.

---

## 🔹 10. View Volume Data on Host

```bash
docker volume inspect myvolume
```

👉 Find the `"Mountpoint"` path.

Then go to it:

```bash
cd /var/lib/docker/volumes/myvolume/_data
```

> ⚠️ Only do this for debug/dev. Don’t manually change files unless you know what you're doing.

---

## 🔚 Summary: When to Use What?

|Situation|Use|
|---|---|
|Persistent data across container restarts|Volume|
|Need to share data between containers|Volume|
|Developing with live file editing|Bind Mount|
|Temporary scratch space|`tmpfs`|
|Easy backup/restore|Volume|

---

## ✅ Practice Tasks for You

1. Create a volume named `dbvolume` and use it with MySQL.
    
2. Share a volume between two busybox containers.
    
3. Create a Docker Compose file that mounts a volume into an Nginx container.
    
4. Try mounting your current directory into a Node container (`$(pwd):/app`) and run code.
