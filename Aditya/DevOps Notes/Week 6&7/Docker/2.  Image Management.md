Here‚Äôs a **detailed and beginner-friendly explanation** of each Docker image command in the table, with **simple words** and **clear examples** so you can understand them easily:

---

### üöÄ 1. **Pull Image**

| **Command**:

```bash
docker pull <image>:<tag>
```

| **What it does**:  
Downloads a Docker image from Docker Hub (or another registry) to your local machine.

| **Explanation**:  
Think of Docker images like recipes. If you want to make a dish (container), you first need the recipe (image). The `pull` command brings the image (recipe) from the internet to your computer.

| **Example**:

```bash
docker pull ubuntu:latest
```

‚û° This downloads the **Ubuntu** image with the **latest** tag (version) to your system.

You can also pull other versions:

```bash
docker pull ubuntu:20.04
```

‚û° This gets the **Ubuntu 20.04** image.

### üìã 2. **List Images**

| **Command**:

```bash
docker images
```

| **What it does**:  
Shows all the images you have downloaded on your system.

| **Explanation**:  
It‚Äôs like checking your local recipe book to see which recipes (images) you already have.

| **Example Output**:

```bash
REPOSITORY   TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED        SIZE
ubuntu       latest    1318b700e415   2 weeks ago    77MB
nginx        alpine    c5a433bcbeba   3 days ago     22MB
```

This tells you:

- The image name (REPOSITORY), like `ubuntu`
    
- The version (TAG), like `latest`
    
- The unique ID of the image (IMAGE ID)
    
- When it was created
    
- How big it is

### üóëÔ∏è 3. **Remove Image**

| **Command**:

```bash
docker rmi <image_id or image_name>
```

| **What it does**:  
Deletes a Docker image from your system.

| **Explanation**:  
If you don‚Äôt need a recipe (image) anymore, you can throw it away to free up space.

| **Example 1**: Remove by name

```bash
docker rmi ubuntu:latest
```

| **Example 2**: Remove by image ID  
If you saw an image with ID `1318b700e415`, you can delete it like this:

```bash
docker rmi 1318b700e415
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: If a container is using the image, you must delete the container first before removing the image.
