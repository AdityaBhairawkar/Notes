## ðŸ”§ Basic Structure of Multi-Stage Build

```dockerfile
# ---- Stage 1: Builder ----
FROM <base-image-for-building> AS <name-of-stage>

# Do your build stuff here
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN <build-commands>

# ---- Stage 2: Final (Clean) Image ----
FROM <base-image-for-running>

# Copy ONLY whatâ€™s needed from the build stage
COPY --from=<name-of-stage> <source-path> <destination-path>

# Set startup command
CMD ["command", "to", "run", "your", "app"]
```

## ðŸ§  What Each Part Means:

|Line|Meaning|
|---|---|
|`FROM`|Starts a new stage. First one builds, second one runs the app.|
|`AS builder`|You **name** the stage so you can refer to it later.|
|`COPY --from=builder`|This copies files **from the first stage** into the second stage.|
|`RUN`|Used to install or build something. Only needed in the build stage.|
|`CMD`|What runs when the container starts (in the final stage only).|

## ðŸ’¡ Example 1: Node.js App (React or Express)

```dockerfile
# Stage 1: Build the app
FROM node:18 AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .
RUN npm run build

# Stage 2: Run the app
FROM nginx:alpine
COPY --from=builder /app/build /usr/share/nginx/html
EXPOSE 80
```

**Use case:** React frontend app

- Stage 1 uses Node to build the app.
    
- Stage 2 uses Nginx to serve it â€” much smaller.

## ðŸ’¡ Example 2: Java App (Maven + Spring Boot)

```dockerfile
# Stage 1: Build .jar file
FROM maven:3.8.6-openjdk-17 AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY pom.xml ./
COPY src ./src
RUN mvn clean package -DskipTests

# Stage 2: Run the .jar file
FROM openjdk:17-jdk-slim
COPY --from=builder /app/target/myapp.jar /app/myapp.jar
CMD ["java", "-jar", "/app/myapp.jar"]
```

**Use case:** Spring Boot backend

- Stage 1 compiles Java and builds the `.jar`.
    
- Stage 2 runs it with a minimal JDK.

## ðŸ’¡ Example 3: Go App (compiled binary)

```dockerfile
# Stage 1: Build Go binary
FROM golang:1.20 AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN go build -o myapp

# Stage 2: Run the binary
FROM alpine:latest
COPY --from=builder /app/myapp /myapp
CMD ["/myapp"]
```

**Use case:** Go microservice

- Final image is tiny (~5MB) with just the compiled binary.

## âœ… Tips for Reusing This in Any Project

1. **Always use `AS builder`** to name your first stage â€” makes it reusable.
    
2. **Final stage should be clean** â€” no source code, no build tools.
    
3. **Use `COPY --from=builder`** to grab only what you need.
    
4. Use small base images in the final stage (e.g., `alpine`, `slim`, or Nginx).
    
5. You can add **more stages** if needed (e.g., a test stage, a build stage, then a final stage).
