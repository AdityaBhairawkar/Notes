Sure! Let's break down each command in **simple and beginner-friendly language**, with **examples**, so you understand **what it does** and **when to use it**.

### 🔸 1. **Remove all stopped containers**

- **Command**: `docker container prune`
    
- **Description**: Deletes all **containers that are not running** (i.e., they have stopped or exited).
    

#### 🔹 What is a _stopped container_?

When you run a Docker container, it may eventually stop — maybe your script finishes or you manually stop it. That stopped container is still on your system and taking up space.

#### ✅ Example:

```bash
docker container prune
```

#### 🧠 What it does:

It will **ask for confirmation** before deleting all stopped containers.

**Output might look like:**

```
WARNING! This will remove all stopped containers.
Are you sure you want to continue? [y/N] y
Deleted Containers:
f3a7c1234567
a8b9c8765432

Total reclaimed space: 100MB
```

### 🔸 2. **Remove unused images**

- **Command**: `docker image prune`
    
- **Description**: Deletes **dangling images** — these are image layers that are **not tagged and not used by any container**.
    

#### 🔹 What is a _dangling image_?

These are leftover image layers after building or updating images. They are not linked to any tag and are just sitting idle.

#### ✅ Example:

```bash
docker image prune
```

#### 🧠 What it does:

It will **ask for confirmation** and then delete unneeded image data.

**Output might look like:**

```
WARNING! This will remove all dangling images.
Are you sure you want to continue? [y/N] y
Deleted Images:
sha256:abcd1234efgh5678

Total reclaimed space: 150MB
```

### 🔸 3. **Remove all unused resources**

- **Command**: `docker system prune`
    
- **Description**: Deletes **everything** that’s not in use:
    
    - Stopped containers
        
    - Dangling images
        
    - Unused networks
        
    - Build cache
        

#### ⚠️ Warning:

This is **stronger** than the other two. Only use if you're sure you don't need any unused stuff.

#### ✅ Example:

```bash
docker system prune
```

#### 🧠 What it does:

It will **clean up your whole Docker environment** (except volumes unless you use `--volumes`).

**Output might look like:**

```
WARNING! This will remove:
  - all stopped containers
  - all networks not used by at least one container
  - all dangling images
  - all build cache
Are you sure you want to continue? [y/N] y
Deleted Containers:
1234abcd5678
Deleted Images:
sha256:abcd1234efgh
Total reclaimed space: 350MB
```
