## 🔐 What Are File Permissions?

In Linux, every file or directory has **permissions** that control **who can read, write, or execute** it.

There are **3 types of users**:

|User Type|Meaning|
|---|---|
|`u`|Owner (user who created the file)|
|`g`|Group (users in the file's group)|
|`o`|Others (everyone else)|
|`a`|All (`u+g+o`)|

---

## 📂 File Ownership

Every file has:

- **Owner** (`user`)
    
- **Group** (`group`)
    

Check ownership using:

```bash
ls -l filename
```

✅ Example:

```bash
ls -l hello.sh
```

Output:

```
-rwxr-xr-- 1 devuser devgroup 123 Apr 6 12:00 hello.sh
```

Breakdown:

- `devuser` → Owner
    
- `devgroup` → Group
    
- `-rwxr-xr--` → Permissions

## 🧾 Understanding Permission Types

|Symbol|Numeric|Meaning|
|---|---|---|
|`r`|4|Read|
|`w`|2|Write|
|`x`|1|Execute|
|`-`|0|No permission|

Each permission set has 3 parts:

```
rwx rwx rwx
 u   g   o
```

Example: `-rwxr-xr--`

- Owner → `rwx` (read, write, execute)
    
- Group → `r-x` (read, execute)
    
- Others → `r--` (read only)
    

---

## 🎯 Changing Permissions

### ✅ Symbolic Mode (using letters)

```bash
chmod u+x filename   # Add execute for owner
chmod g-w filename   # Remove write from group
chmod o=r filename   # Set read-only for others
chmod a+x filename   # Add execute for all
```

✅ Example:

```bash
chmod u=rw,g=r,o= filename
```

Means: owner can read/write, group read-only, others no access

---

### ✅ Numeric Mode (using numbers)

```bash
chmod 754 filename
```

How to calculate:

- Owner: 7 = 4+2+1 = `rwx`
    
- Group: 5 = 4+0+1 = `r-x`
    
- Others: 4 = `r--`
    

|Value|Meaning|
|---|---|
|`7`|`rwx`|
|`6`|`rw-`|
|`5`|`r-x`|
|`4`|`r--`|
|`3`|`-wx`|
|`2`|`-w-`|
|`1`|`--x`|
|`0`|`---`|

---

## 🔄 Changing Ownership

```bash
sudo chown username filename
sudo chown username:groupname filename
```

✅ Example:

```bash
sudo chown devuser:devgroup hello.sh
```

---

## 📁 Directory Permissions

### Read (`r`)

Can list files (`ls`)

### Write (`w`)

Can create/delete/rename files

### Execute (`x`)

Can enter the directory (`cd`)

✅ Example:

```bash
chmod 755 /mydir
```

Means:

- Owner: full access
    
- Group & Others: can read and enter, but not write
    

---

## 🔒 Real Scenarios

### ✅ Scenario 1: Make a Script Executable Only for You

```bash
chmod 700 deploy.sh
```

- Only owner can `read/write/execute`
    

---

### ✅ Scenario 2: Web Directory — Read for All, No Write

```bash
chmod 755 index.html
```

- Everyone can view it
    
- Only owner can edit
    

---

### ✅ Scenario 3: Private Config File

```bash
chmod 600 config.env
```

- Only owner can `read/write`
    
- No one else can access
    

---

### ✅ Scenario 4: Shared Group Folder

```bash
mkdir /shared
sudo chown root:devgroup /shared
chmod 770 /shared
```

- Owner + group can `rwx`
    
- Others have no access
    

---

### ✅ Scenario 5: File Can Only Be Executed

```bash
chmod 111 run.sh
```

- No reading or writing
    
- Just execution — rare but possible in controlled environments
