### ðŸ”¹ **Group 1: Core Basics (Foundation)**

> Focus: Understanding syntax, basic scripting, variables, and basic control.

- **1. Variables**
    
- **14. Arithmetic Operations (`$(( ))`)**
    
- **7. String Manipulation**
    
- **8. Command Substitution**
    
- **9. Reading User Input**
    

These are the essentials to interact with data and users. Understanding variables, doing arithmetic, and processing strings are all connected and often used together in practice.

### ðŸ”¹ **Group 2: Control Flow**

> Focus: Learning how to control the execution of code.
12, 13, 14 shell scripting 
- **2. Conditionals (`if`, `else`, `elif`)**
    
- **4. Case Statements**
    
- **11. Exit Status and `&&`, `||`**
    
- **13. File Testing (`-f`, `-d`, `-e`, etc.)**
    

These constructs are all about **decision-making**. Youâ€™ll often use file testing inside conditionals or to check command success.

### ðŸ”¹ **Group 3: Loops and Logic**

> Focus: Repetition and control in loops.

- **3. Loops (`for`, `while`, `until`)**
    
- **12. Loops with `break`, `continue`**
    
- **6. Arrays**
    

Arrays naturally fit with loops, especially `for`. Control structures like `break` and `continue` are key when working with logic-heavy loops.

### ðŸ”¹ **Group 4: Functions and Scripts**

> Focus: Writing reusable, modular code.

- **5. Functions**
    
- **10. Positional Parameters / Arguments (`$1`, `$2`, etc.)**
    

These are essential when moving from small scripts to more structured, reusable code. Positional parameters are frequently used inside functions to handle inputs.

### ðŸ”¹ **Group 5: File Operations**

> Focus: Input/output, file redirection, and real-world tasks.

- **15. Working with Files (`cat`, `echo`, `>>`, `>`, `<`, etc.)**
    

File operations are practical skills used in every script. Once the basics are understood, this becomes intuitive and useful.
