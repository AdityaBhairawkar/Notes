# ✅ **Step-by-Step Plan to Get a Cloud Job in 2025**

---

### 🔰 **Step 1: Solidify Linux, Bash, and Git** _(Duration: 5–7 days)_

✅ What to Do:

- Revisit basic Linux commands (file, user, permissions, networking)
    
- Practice bash scripting: loops, if-else, functions, cron
    
- Revise Git: push, pull, branch, merge
    

🎯 Goal:

- Be able to **write a working script**
    
- Use **GitHub to push your code**
    
- Be confident with **command line and SSH**

### ☁️ **Step 2: Master AWS Core Services (Job-Focused)** _(Duration: 3 weeks)_

✅ What to Learn & Practice:

|Service|Task|
|---|---|
|IAM|Create users, groups, attach least privilege policies|
|EC2|Launch, connect via SSH, deploy simple app (e.g., Nginx, Docker)|
|S3|Create buckets, upload/download files, static site hosting|
|VPC|Create VPC, public/private subnets, security groups|
|RDS|Launch MySQL/Postgres DB, connect from EC2|
|CloudWatch|Set up alarms on EC2, monitor logs and metrics|

🎯 Goal:

- Launch and manage services yourself
    
- Connect services together (EC2 + RDS + S3)
    
- Deploy simple apps or host static sites
    

🛠️ Tools: AWS CLI, AWS Console

---

### 💼 **Step 3: Build Your First Cloud Project** _(Duration: 1 week)_

📌 **Project 1: Static Website on AWS**

- Host HTML site in **S3**
    
- Add **CloudFront** (CDN)
    
- Use **Route 53** (optional) for custom domain
    
- Set IAM policy to make it public
    

🎯 Deliverable:

- GitHub Repo with:
    
    - `README.md`
        
    - Architecture diagram (use draw.io or Canva)
        
    - Screenshots or deployment steps
        

---

### 🐳 **Step 4: Solidify Docker & Use It in Projects** _(Duration: 1.5 weeks)_

✅ What to Practice:

- Write Dockerfile for a small app (Python, Node, Bash script)
    
- Use Docker Compose to run multi-container apps (e.g., app + DB)
    
- Push custom Docker image to Docker Hub
    

📌 **Mini Project 2: Dockerized Log Uploader**

- Python/Bash app logs system status
    
- Stores logs in a file or uploads to S3
    
- Dockerize it and run with `docker-compose`
    

🎯 Deliverable:

- GitHub Repo with working `Dockerfile` + `docker-compose.yml`
    

---

### 🧱 **Step 5: Learn Terraform (IaC)** _(Duration: 1.5 weeks)_

✅ What to Do:

- Learn basics of `.tf` files, `provider`, `resource`, `variables`
    
- Use Terraform to:
    
    - Launch EC2
        
    - Create S3 bucket
        
    - Set up IAM user
        

📌 **Project 3: Terraform EC2 Setup**

- Use `.tf` to:
    
    - Create EC2 in custom VPC
        
    - Attach security group
        
    - Use `user_data` to install Nginx or app
        

🎯 Deliverable:

- GitHub Repo with `.tf` files
    
- Output and instructions in `README.md`
    

---

### ⚙️ **Step 6: Light CI/CD (optional for Cloud, essential for DevOps)** _(Duration: 1 week)_

If you want to show end-to-end automation:

✅ What to Try:

- Use **Jenkins** or **GitHub Actions** to:
    
    - Trigger on Git push
        
    - Build Docker image
        
    - Deploy on EC2 or push to Docker Hub
        

📌 **Mini Project 4: CI/CD Pipeline**

- Code pushed to GitHub triggers Docker build
    
- Image pushed to Docker Hub or deployed to EC2
    

🎯 Deliverable:

- GitHub Repo with:
    
    - `Jenkinsfile` or GitHub Actions `.yaml`
        
    - Project code
        

---

### 🎯 **Step 7: Final Prep & Apply for Jobs** _(Ongoing)_

✅ What to Do:

|Task|Goal|
|---|---|
|Resume|Focus on **skills + projects** (not just courses)|
|GitHub|All projects with clean `README.md` and usage steps|
|LinkedIn|Update with “Cloud|
|Job Hunt|Apply to 10–20 jobs/week (Cloud Support, Infra Intern, L1 Cloud Engineer)|
|Mock Interviews|Practice explaining: EC2, S3, Docker, Terraform, CI/CD|

---

## 🚀 Final Advice

- 🧠 Focus on **doing**, not just watching tutorials
    
- 🎯 Don’t wait for “perfect skill” — start applying after 2–3 good projects
    
- 🔁 Keep building — recruiters hire based on what you’ve **done**, not what you’ve **learned**
