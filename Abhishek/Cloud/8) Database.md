### **Database**
A database is a data-store that stores semi-structured and structured data.

Databases can be generally categorized as either: 
- Relational databases:
 Structured data that strongly represents tabular data (tables, rows and columns) Row-oriented or Columnar-oriented 
- Non-relational databases 
 Semi-structured that may or may not distantly resemble tabular data.

Databases have a rich set of functionality: 
- specialized language to query (retrieve data) 
- specialized modeling strategies to optimize retrieval for different use cases 
- more fine tune control over the transformation of the data into useful data structures or reports

### **Data Warehouse**

A relational datastore designed for analytic workloads, which is generally column-oriented data-store

Companies will have terabytes and millions of rows of data, and they need a fast way to be able to produce analytics reports

Data warehouses generally perform aggregation 
- aggregation is grouping data eg. find a total or average 
- Data warehouses are optimized around columns since they need to quickly aggerate column data
Data warehouses are generally designed be HOT Hot means they can return queries very fast even though they have vast amounts of data

Data warehouses are infrequently accessed meaning they aren't intended for real-time reporting but maybe once or twice a a day or once a week to generate business and user reports. A data warehouse needs to consume data from a relational databases on a regular basis.

### **NoSQL Database Service (AWS)**

**NoSQL databases** are designed to handle large amounts of unstructured and semi-structured data. These databases do not rely on the traditional **relational database model** and provide flexibility in terms of scalability, performance, and handling different data types. AWS offers several fully managed NoSQL database services to meet different use cases, including **document**, **key-value**, **wide-column**, and **graph databases**.
