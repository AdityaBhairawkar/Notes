    - **Resource Control**: You have **full control** over the physical server's resources (e.g., CPU cores, memory, etc.).
    - **Licensing**: Allows **BYOL** options for software licensing, including **Windows Server** and **SQL Server**.
    - **Visibility**: You can **view** and manage the placement of instances on the host. This allows for **custom control** over your physical infrastructure.
    - **Use Case**: Ideal for organizations with **strict compliance** or licensing needs, or those who need **high levels of control** over physical hardware placement.
    - **Example**: When your application needs to meet **specific licensing requirements**, or you need to run workloads that must remain on **physical hardware**.
2. **Dedicated Instance**:
    
    - **Definition**: A **virtual server** that runs on **hardware dedicated to a single customer**. However, the exact server on which your instance runs is not visible to you.
    - **Resource Control**: You **do not control** the physical host your instance runs on, but it is isolated at the hardware level from other customers' instances.
    - **Licensing**: Like Dedicated Hosts, you can run **BYOL** instances but **without the ability to control physical server placement**.
    - **Visibility**: You have **no visibility** into the physical host, but the instance is **dedicated** to you.
    - **Use Case**: Ideal for workloads that need **hardware isolation** but do not require full control over the physical infrastructure.
    - **Example**: Use for **dedicated resources** when you donâ€™t need to control instance placement but need the isolation from other customers.

    - **Resource Isolation**: The instance runs on hardware isolated from other customers' EC2 instances, though **you donâ€™t have control over the specific physical server**.
    - **Use Case**: Ideal for workloads that need **hardware isolation** but not necessarily full control over the physical host (e.g., **compliance** or **security requirements**).
    - **Key Points**:
        - **Isolated hardware** with no sharing of physical servers between customers.
        - Supports **BYOL (Bring Your Own License)** for certain software like **Windows** or **SQL Server**.
3. **Host Tenancy (Dedicated Hosts)**:
    
    - **Definition**: In this mode, EC2 instances run on **a physical server dedicated exclusively to your account**. You have **full control** over instance placement on the dedicated host.
    - **Resource Isolation**: You can place multiple instances on the same **dedicated host**, and you have full visibility and control over the **physical server**. This is ideal for **license management** or **compliance** needs.
    - **Use Case**: Useful when you need **full control** over instance placement, such as for specific **licensing compliance** (e.g., **SAP HANA**), **regulatory requirements**, or high-performance **workloads** that need to run on specific hardware.
    - **Key Points**:
        - Full control over instance **placement and scheduling**.
        - **Bring Your Own License (BYOL)** is supported.
        - **Higher cost** than other tenancy options because you are renting an entire physical server.

---

 **Key Differences**:

|**Feature**|**Default Tenancy**|**Dedicated Tenancy**|**Host Tenancy (Dedicated Hosts)**|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Hardware Isolation**|Shared physical hardware with other users.|Isolated physical hardware, but not under your control.|Fully isolated physical host, with control over instance placement.|
|**Licensing**|Standard AWS licenses or **BYOL** (for specific software).|**BYOL** support for certain software.|**BYOL** for all supported software, with full control over licensing.|
|**Visibility & Control**|No visibility or control over physical host.|Limited control over placement; no physical server visibility.|Full control and visibility of the physical server.|
|**Cost**|Lowest cost, shared resources.|Higher cost than Default Tenancy, but isolated hardware.|Highest cost due to dedicated hardware and full control.|
|**Use Case**|General-purpose workloads with no strict hardware isolation.|Workloads that need **isolation** but not full control.|Use for **license-bound workloads**, **compliance**, or specific performance needs.|

---

 **Key Points**:

- **Default Tenancy**: **Shared hardware**, cost-effective, used for most general workloads.
- **Dedicated Tenancy**: **Isolated hardware** with **no control** over instance placement, suitable for workloads needing isolation (e.g., compliance).
