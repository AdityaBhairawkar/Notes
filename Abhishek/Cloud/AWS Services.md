### Summary and Key AWS Services

Amazon Web Services (AWS) started in 2006 with three core services—**storage buckets (S3)**, **compute instances (EC2)**, and a **messaging queue**—and has since expanded to over 200 services. Below is a categorized summary of key AWS services with examples.

---

### **1. Compute Services**

- **EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)**: Create and manage virtual servers.  
    _Example_: Hosting a web application on a scalable instance.
    
- **Elastic Load Balancer**: Distributes traffic across multiple servers.  
    _Example_: Ensuring high availability for your application.
    
- **Auto Scaling**: Automatically adjusts the number of instances based on demand.  
    _Example_: Scaling up during peak traffic times.
    
- **Elastic Beanstalk**: Simplified app deployment.  
    _Example_: Deploying a Ruby on Rails app without manual server management.
    
- **Lambda**: Serverless computing; runs code in response to events.  
    _Example_: Processing image uploads dynamically.
    
- **Outposts**: AWS services on-premises for hybrid cloud setups.  
    _Example_: Running AWS APIs in a private data center.
    
- **Lightsail**: Simplified hosting for small-scale applications.  
    _Example_: Deploying a WordPress blog.

### **2. Storage Services**

- **S3 (Simple Storage Service)**: Object storage for any type of file.  
    _Example_: Storing website assets like images and videos.
    
- **Glacier**: Low-cost archive storage.  
    _Example_: Storing long-term backups.
    
- **EBS (Elastic Block Store)**: High-performance block storage for EC2.  
    _Example_: Running a high-throughput database.
    
- **EFS (Elastic File System)**: Fully managed shared file storage.  
    _Example_: Storing application data shared across multiple EC2 instances.

### **3. Database Services**

- **RDS (Relational Database Service)**: Managed SQL databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL).  
    _Example_: Hosting a MySQL database for an e-commerce app.
    
- **Aurora**: High-performance SQL database with serverless options.  
    _Example_: Scalable MySQL-compatible database for global applications.
    
- **DynamoDB**: NoSQL database for fast, scalable storage.  
    _Example_: Building a real-time gaming leaderboard.
    
- **Elasticache**: Managed in-memory caching (Redis, Memcached).  
    _Example_: Caching frequently accessed data to reduce latency.
    
- **Neptune**: Managed graph database.  
    _Example_: Building a social media recommendation engine.

### **4. Analytics and Data Processing**

- **Redshift**: Data warehousing for structured analytics.  
    _Example_: Combining multiple data sources for business intelligence.
    
- **Kinesis**: Real-time data streaming.  
    _Example_: Monitoring live server logs.
    
- **EMR (Elastic MapReduce)**: Big data processing with Apache Spark or Hadoop.  
    _Example_: Running large-scale machine learning models.
    
- **Glue**: Serverless ETL (Extract, Transform, Load).  
    _Example_: Preparing data for analysis in Redshift.

### **5. Machine Learning**

- **SageMaker**: Building, training, and deploying ML models.  
    _Example_: Creating a model to predict customer churn.
    
- **Rekognition**: Image and video analysis.  
    _Example_: Automating facial recognition in security systems.
    
- **Polly**: Text-to-speech service.  
    _Example_: Converting text articles into audio.

### **6. IoT and Edge Computing**

- **IoT Core**: Manage IoT devices and collect data.  
    _Example_: Monitoring smart home devices.
    
- **Snow Devices**: Data processing in remote locations.  
    _Example_: Collecting data in Arctic research stations.
    

---

### **7. Developer Tools**

- **CodePipeline**: Continuous delivery service.  
    _Example_: Automating code deployments.
    
- **CloudFormation**: Infrastructure as code (IaC).  
    _Example_: Automating resource provisioning for a complex app.
