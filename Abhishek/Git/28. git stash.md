Sure! Let's dive deep into **`git stash`**, especially focusing on `git stash pop` and deleting stashes — all explained in **simple, easy-to-understand language** with **multiple examples** for a DevOps engineer like you.

## 🧠 What is `git stash`?

Imagine you're working on some changes, but suddenly you need to:

- Switch to another branch quickly
    
- Pull the latest code
    
- Test something else
    

But you **don’t want to commit** your half-done work.  
So, you **stash** your changes. Think of it as **"putting your work temporarily in a safe drawer"**.

---

## 🧰 Basic `git stash` Usage

```bash
git stash
```

This stashes:

- Tracked modified files
    
- Tracked staged files
    

🟨 It **doesn’t stash untracked files** by default.

To stash untracked files too:

```bash
git stash -u   # or --include-untracked
```

---

## 🔁 `git stash pop` vs `git stash apply`

Both are used to get your stashed work back.

### `git stash pop`

```bash
git stash pop
```

- **Applies** the most recent stash
    
- Then **removes it** from the stash list
    

🟩 Example:

```bash
git stash       # puts changes in stash@{0}
git stash pop   # gets stash@{0} back and deletes it
```

---

### `git stash apply`

```bash
git stash apply
```

- **Applies** the most recent stash
    
- But **keeps it** in the stash list
    

🟨 Good when you're not sure if you’ll need to apply it again.

---

## 📂 Working with Multiple Stashes

Each stash gets a name like:

```
stash@{0} - WIP on main: 123abc4 some message
stash@{1} - WIP on dev: 789xyz1 another change
```

To list all stashes:

```bash
git stash list
```

To apply a specific one:

```bash
git stash apply stash@{1}
```

To pop a specific one:

```bash
git stash pop stash@{1}
```

---

## 🗑️ Deleting a Git Stash

### 1. Delete the most recent stash

```bash
git stash drop
```

OR

```bash
git stash drop stash@{0}
```

### 2. Delete a specific stash

```bash
git stash drop stash@{2}
```

### 3. Delete **all** stashes

```bash
git stash clear
```

⚠️ This **cannot be undone** — all stashes are gone.

## 🔥 Real DevOps-like Examples

### ✅ Scenario 1: Quick fix in production

You're editing a deployment script in `dev` branch, then suddenly:

> “Urgent fix needed on `main` branch!”

```bash
git stash         # Save your work
git checkout main
# fix and commit the urgent issue
git checkout dev
git stash pop     # Get your work back and remove stash
```

---

### ✅ Scenario 2: Apply same work to multiple branches

You were editing monitoring configs, and want to apply same changes to `staging` and `production`:

```bash
git stash                 # stash changes
git checkout staging
git stash apply           # apply the stash (but keep it)
# commit if needed
git checkout production
git stash pop             # apply and remove it this time
```

---

### ✅ Scenario 3: Cleaning up old stashes

After weeks of work, you want to delete all cluttered stashes:

```bash
git stash list
# If you're sure:
git stash clear
```

---

## ⚠️ Stash Conflicts

Sometimes `git stash pop` causes merge conflicts if files have changed a lot:

```bash
git stash pop
# Conflicts appear
# Fix them, then:
git add .
git commit -m "resolved stash conflict"
```

---

## 🧪 Check Before You Pop

Preview stash content:

```bash
git stash show stash@{0}
git stash show -p stash@{0}   # detailed patch view
```
