Sure! Letâ€™s break down everything you need to know about the `git show <commit-id>:<file-path>` command **in simple terms**, with **clear examples**, especially from a **DevOps perspective**.

---

## ðŸ”¹ What is `git show <commit-id>:<file-path>`?

This command lets you: âœ… View the **contents of a file** as it was in a **specific commit**  
âœ… Useful when you want to **check historical versions** of a file  
âœ… You **donâ€™t switch branches** or **checkout** â€” just view the file directly

---

## ðŸ”¹ Syntax Breakdown

```bash
git show <commit-id>:<path-to-file>
```

- `commit-id`: The SHA hash (or part of it) of the commit you want to view
    
- `path-to-file`: The file path relative to the repo root

## ðŸ”¹ Basic Example 1 â€“ View old version of a config file

Imagine youâ€™re working on a **DevOps project**, and someone changed the `nginx.conf` file. You want to see how it looked 3 commits ago.

```bash
git log --oneline
```

You see:

```bash
a1b2c3d Fix nginx config
9f8e7d6 Add SSL support
7c6b5a4 Initial nginx config
```

Now to view how the file looked in the initial config:

```bash
git show 7c6b5a4:nginx/nginx.conf
```

âœ… This shows the **nginx.conf** file as it was in the **`7c6b5a4` commit**.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Example 2 â€“ View a Dockerfile from an older commit

Say you want to compare how a `Dockerfile` looked before a recent change:

```bash
git log -- Dockerfile
```

You see:

```bash
c3d4e5f Update base image
b2c3d4e Added multi-stage build
```

To view before the multi-stage build was added:

```bash
git show b2c3d4e:Dockerfile
```

---

## ðŸ”¹ Example 3 â€“ View a Kubernetes YAML before a change

Letâ€™s say your `deployment.yaml` was modified and caused an issue in production.

```bash
git log -- k8s/deployment.yaml
```

You see:

```bash
f1e2d3c Update replicas to 5
e4d5c6b Initial deployment file
```

To view the original config:

```bash
git show e4d5c6b:k8s/deployment.yaml
```

---

## ðŸ”¹ Example 4 â€“ Save the file to your system

Instead of just viewing the old file, maybe you want to **save it for testing**.

```bash
git show <commit-id>:<file-path> > old-file.yaml
```

Example:

```bash
git show e4d5c6b:k8s/deployment.yaml > deployment-old.yaml
```

Now you have the older file saved locally.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Example 5 â€“ Use in a script for automation (DevOps use case)

You can use this in a script to **extract versions of files** and compare them.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Compare old vs current Dockerfile

git show b2c3d4e:Dockerfile > old_dockerfile
diff old_dockerfile Dockerfile
```

Use this to **detect what changed** between versions â€” helpful for debugging builds!

---

## ðŸ”¹ Pro Tips as a DevOps Engineer

- Use `git show` to **debug infrastructure changes** (Terraform, Ansible, YAMLs, etc.)
    
- Combine it with `diff` to compare versions of config files
    
- Great for **postmortem analysis** when tracking down root cause after deployment issues
    
- Avoids needing to `checkout` or switch branches â€” safer in production environments

## ðŸ”¹ Common Errors and Fixes

|Error|Why it happens|Fix|
|---|---|---|
|`fatal: Path 'file' does not exist in 'commit-id'`|File didnâ€™t exist in that commit|Double-check if the file existed in that commit|
|`fatal: bad object`|Wrong commit ID or typo|Use `git log` and copy the correct SHA|
|File shows up empty|Maybe file was created but empty in that commit|Check other nearby commits|

---

## ðŸ”¹ Summary (Cheat Sheet Style)

|Task|Command|
|---|---|
|View old file version|`git show <commit-id>:<file>`|
|Save old version to file|`git show <commit-id>:<file> > old.txt`|
|View commit history for a file|`git log -- <file>`|
|Compare with current version|`diff <(git show <commit-id>:<file>) <file>`|
