Sure! Let’s break down **`git restore`** in a **DevOps-friendly**, **easy-to-understand** way with **clear, practical examples**.

---

## 🔧 What is `git restore`?

`git restore` is used to **undo changes** in your working directory. It was introduced in Git **2.23+** to make undoing things easier and more intuitive.

## 🚨 Why DevOps Engineers Should Know This

As a DevOps engineer, you work with code, scripts, configurations, and CI/CD pipelines that are **version-controlled with Git**. Mistakes happen — wrong edits, broken configurations, or bad merges. `git restore` helps you **quickly go back to a safe state** without messing up your repo.

---

## 🧠 Syntax

```bash
git restore [options] <file>...
```

You can restore files from:

1. **HEAD** (last commit)
    
2. **Another commit or branch**
    
3. **Staging area (undo git add)**
    

---

# ✅ Use Case 1: Undo changes in working directory

### 🧾 Scenario:

You edited a script, but want to discard changes.

```bash
git restore script.sh
```

🔍 This **discards local changes** and restores `script.sh` from the last commit (`HEAD`).

> ⚠️ **Permanent** if not committed or stashed!

---

# ✅ Use Case 2: Restore multiple files

```bash
git restore file1.sh file2.sh
```

Restores both files to how they were in the last commit.

---

# ✅ Use Case 3: Restore entire working directory

```bash
git restore .
```

This undoes changes in **all modified files** in the current directory and subdirectories.

> You’ll lose **all uncommitted changes**.

---

# ✅ Use Case 4: Restore from another branch or commit

### 🧾 Scenario:

You want a file from another branch (e.g., `main`) but don't want to switch branches.

```bash
git restore --source main deploy.sh
```

This gets the version of `deploy.sh` from the `main` branch and restores it to your working directory.

You can also use a commit hash:

```bash
git restore --source abc123 config.yml
```

---

# ✅ Use Case 5: Undo `git add` (unstage a file)

### 🧾 Scenario:

You used `git add` by mistake but didn’t commit yet.

```bash
git restore --staged server.sh
```

This **unstages** the file — puts it back to working directory but **keeps changes**.

---

# ✅ Use Case 6: Restore both staged and working copy

```bash
git restore --source=HEAD --staged --worktree main.py
```

This:

- Unstages `main.py`
    
- Discards local changes
    
- Brings it back to how it was in the last commit
    

---

# ✅ Use Case 7: Restore a deleted file

### 🧾 Scenario:

You accidentally deleted a file and want to bring it back.

```bash
git restore deleted_file.sh
```

As long as it was tracked and committed before, this restores it from the last commit.

---

## 🧪 BONUS: Dry run with `--dry-run`

See what will happen before you actually do it.

```bash
git restore --dry-run important.sh
```

No changes are made — just tells you if it would work.

---

## 🛑 Summary Table

|Use Case|Command|What It Does|
|---|---|---|
|Discard local changes|`git restore file.sh`|Resets file to last commit|
|Unstage file|`git restore --staged file.sh`|Removes from staging|
|Restore from another branch|`git restore --source branch file.sh`|Gets file from that branch|
|Restore deleted file|`git restore file.sh`|Brings it back|
|Restore whole repo|`git restore .`|Undo all local changes|
|Undo both staged + working changes|`git restore --staged --worktree file.sh`|Full reset of that file|

## 🧠 Tip for DevOps

When working in automation scripts, infra-as-code (Terraform, Ansible, etc.), or Dockerfiles, `git restore` is your friend when:

- You try an idea and it breaks
    
- You accidentally edit or stage the wrong file
    
- You want to test an older version quickly
