Great! Let's break down the `git log --since=""` and `git log --until=""` commands **step by step**, using **simple explanations and multiple examples** so that it's crystal clear.

---

## 🔧 What is `git log --since=""` and `--until=""`?

These are **date filters** used with `git log` to show **commits within a specific time range**.

- `--since=""` shows commits **after** a given date.
    
- `--until=""` shows commits **before** a given date.
    
- You can use them together to get commits **between** two dates.
    

---

## ✅ Basic Syntax

```bash
git log --since="DATE"
git log --until="DATE"
git log --since="DATE1" --until="DATE2"
```

---

## 📅 Acceptable Date Formats

Git is super flexible with dates. You can use:

- Exact dates: `"2024-04-01"`
    
- Natural language: `"2 days ago"`, `"last week"`, `"1 week ago"`, `"yesterday"`, `"2024-01-01 10:00"`
    
- Relative dates with time: `"2024-04-01 14:00"`

## 🔍 Basic Examples

### 🟢 1. Show commits **since yesterday**

```bash
git log --since="yesterday"
```

This shows all commits made from **yesterday to now**.

---

### 🟢 2. Show commits **since 3 days ago**

```bash
git log --since="3 days ago"
```

This shows commits from the **last 3 days**.

---

### 🟢 3. Show commits **until a specific date**

```bash
git log --until="2024-04-10"
```

This shows commits that were **made before or on April 10th**.

---

### 🟢 4. Show commits **between two dates**

```bash
git log --since="2024-04-01" --until="2024-04-15"
```

This gives you commits between **April 1st and April 15th**.

---

### 🟢 5. Combine with `--pretty` for cleaner output

```bash
git log --since="last week" --until="yesterday" --pretty=oneline
```

This shows **short one-line commit messages** between last week and yesterday.

---

### 🟢 6. Show commits in the last hour

```bash
git log --since="1 hour ago"
```

Useful for checking recent work after a lunch break, for example.

---

### 🟢 7. Combine with author filtering

```bash
git log --since="2024-04-01" --until="2024-04-20" --author="Alice"
```

This shows **only Alice's commits** between April 1st and 20th.

---

### 🟢 8. Show only file-related commits in a date range

```bash
git log --since="2024-04-01" --until="2024-04-10" -- path/to/file.txt
```

Only shows commits that **touched that specific file** in the given time range.

---

### 🟢 9. See commits in reverse (oldest first)

```bash
git log --since="2024-04-01" --reverse
```

By default, Git shows the **most recent commits first**. `--reverse` flips the order.

---

## 🧠 DevOps Use Cases

- ✅ Auditing recent deployments (e.g., "What got committed in the last 2 days?")
    
- ✅ Investigating incidents ("What was pushed before this issue started?")
    
- ✅ Filtering logs in CI/CD pipelines
    
- ✅ Tracking team activity during sprints
    

---

## 🧪 Advanced Tip: With `--stat` for file changes

```bash
git log --since="2024-04-01" --until="2024-04-10" --stat
```

This shows **what files were changed** and **how many lines were added/removed**.

---
