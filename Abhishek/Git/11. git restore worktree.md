Alright! Let’s break down `git restore --worktree` in a way that's super clear, detailed, and includes **multiple examples** relevant for you as a **DevOps engineer**.

---

## 🔧 What is `git restore --worktree`?

When you use `git restore --worktree`, you are telling Git:

> "Hey, I want to get the version of this file that exists in the **index/staging area** and restore it in my **working directory** (the actual file on disk)."

This is useful when:

- You **staged a change** with `git add`, and want to **undo the changes in your working directory**, but **keep it staged**.
    
- You accidentally edited a file and want to restore your last staged version.

## 📁 Git Areas to Understand First

|Area|Description|
|---|---|
|**Working Directory**|Your actual files (you can open/edit them)|
|**Staging Area (Index)**|What will be committed next (added using `git add`)|
|**Repository (HEAD)**|The last committed version|

---

## 🧠 So what does `git restore --worktree` do?

It **resets the file in your working directory** to match the version in the **staging area**, but **does not unstage it**.

---

## ✅ Basic Syntax

```bash
git restore --worktree <file>
```

---

## 🔍 Example 1: Restore working directory file after edits

### Situation:

You accidentally made changes to `app.py`, but had already staged your previous edits.

```bash
# Step 1: Make and stage changes
echo "print('Hello DevOps!')" > app.py
git add app.py

# Step 2: Accidentally modify the file again
echo "# temporary debug line" >> app.py

# Step 3: Restore to staged version
git restore --worktree app.py
```

### What happens:

- The debug line is removed.
    
- The file is back to how it was when you staged it.
    
- Changes are still staged in index, ready to commit.

## 🔍 Example 2: Use it with a config file (a common DevOps case)

Imagine you're working on a config file: `nginx.conf`

```bash
# You modified it locally:
nano nginx.conf

# But you already staged a version for commit earlier
git add nginx.conf

# Then, you decide: "Nah, I want the staged version back"
git restore --worktree nginx.conf
```

✅ Useful when managing config files or infrastructure code and accidentally mess up.

---

## 🔍 Example 3: Multiple files at once

```bash
git restore --worktree file1.sh file2.sh file3.yaml
```

Restores all 3 files in working directory to their **staged versions**.

---

## 🔍 Example 4: Restore all files in the repo (careful ⚠️)

```bash
git restore --worktree .
```

This restores **every tracked file in your working directory** to match what's in the staging area.

---

## 🧪 Compare with `git restore` (no flags)

Here’s a quick comparison:

|Command|What it restores|Useful when|
|---|---|---|
|`git restore <file>`|Restores from HEAD (last commit)|You want to discard _all_ changes (staged + unstaged)|
|`git restore --staged <file>`|Unstages the file|You want to undo `git add`|
|`git restore --worktree <file>`|Restores working dir from staging|You want to undo working dir changes but keep staged version|

---

## ⚡ DevOps Real World Use Cases

### 🛠️ 1. Infrastructure as Code (Terraform/Ansible/etc.)

You're modifying an `infrastructure.tf` file. You test a change, stage it, and make further local edits to test something.

Now you want to go back to the staged version and keep it for commit:

```bash
git restore --worktree infrastructure.tf
```

### 🛠️ 2. CI/CD Pipeline YAML Files

You've staged your `.gitlab-ci.yml` or `build.yaml` with some changes.

But then test a new config locally and it breaks. Want to undo just the working copy?

```bash
git restore --worktree .gitlab-ci.yml
```

### 🛠️ 3. Dockerfiles or K8s Manifests

Same idea—working with `Dockerfile` or `deployment.yaml`?

If you’re experimenting but want to reset to your last staged version:

```bash
git restore --worktree Dockerfile
```

---

## 💡 Pro Tip

If you're ever unsure what's staged vs unstaged, use:

```bash
git status
```

It will help you understand the current state of your files.

---

## 🔄 Combine with other restore commands

Want to undo both staged and working directory changes?

```bash
git restore --staged file && git restore file
```

---

## 🧵 Summary

|Command|Description|
|---|---|
|`git restore --worktree file`|Restore file in working dir from staging area|
|`git restore --staged file`|Unstage the file|
|`git restore file`|Restore file from last commit (HEAD)|
